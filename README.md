# Covid-19 States-Data Dashboard

## Background
Covid-19 has taken over the world unlike any other global pandemic has ever done in the past. The flow of information has been absolutely critical over this period for people all over the world to be informed about the most up-to-date stats and findings about the disease, in order to be prepared and alert. There has been no dearth in information sources regarding COVID-19, some that are easy to access and understand, and many that are either too complicated for the majority of internet users to access, or are intended to spread fake information and propaganda.

## Proposed Project
Using API calls or from online data repositories such as Kaggle or data.world, gather COVID related information to build a data dashboard that displays information such as total number of people that are infected, recovered, deceased, etc. broken down by each state in an easy to understand, decluttered fashion.

## Steps:
### Extracting data
Using at least two original data sources, gather the necessary information that is relevant to the project using either API calls or web scraping.
#### Sources
1. https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
2. https://covidtracking.com/data
3. https://data.world/mgecmen/covid-19/workspace/file?filename=US+State+Population
### Transforming data
Clean the raw data using python/pandas so as to be able to easily display on the dashboard.
### Loading the dashboard
Build a web interface dashboard to display the data separated by state.
